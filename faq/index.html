<h1>FAQ</h1>
This page is generally for the questions I get, either in dms, MCPEDL comments, YouTube comments, etc etc.

<h2>When will you release this addon or that addon?</h2>
IDK. I can't predict the future plus I tend to slack off every now and then. Plus, if you ever pester me with this question the release date will get further and further from when I expect to release it, so unless you stop pestering me I will not release it.

<h2>When will you update any of your addons?</h2>
Same answer as above. Plus if you keep pestering me with questions of such nature well I'll go ahead and block you.

<h2>Can you add this or that to any of your addons?</h2>
If I find it interesting yes. Otherwise I'll have to think about it before saying no.

<h2>Will you code my addon? Will you code my model into Minecraft?</h2>
No, especially since its probably not gonna be worth my time anyway. I only code addons for my friends if they ask about it.
