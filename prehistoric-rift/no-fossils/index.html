<h1>Why Prehistoric Rift Will Never Have Fossils</h1>

<p>
Nearly every dinosaur addon or mod to ever exist has something involving bringing back dinosaurs from the dead, but you know what, fuck that. I'm literally tired of digging up fossils and using fancy science fiction equipment to create dinosaurs or going to alternate dimensions to see dinosaurs. To the point where I'm bored of it. I don't want to put any effort into doing all that shit. I want to see the dinosaurs RIGHT NOW, RIGHT AT THE VERY MOMENT I SPAWN IN.

And yes, I can't really write in more than 200 words on why I won't add fossils, but this random ass page on my website is the best way to explain why.
