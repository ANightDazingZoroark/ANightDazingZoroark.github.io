<h2>0.5.2 Patch Notes</h2>
<p>This is just an art update. Basically, nearly every item will be replaced by brand new textures made by me. The main reason for this change was because most of them happen to be made by other people for me. While I am grateful for their kind contributions I want to reduce my dependency on others for working on this addon.</p>
