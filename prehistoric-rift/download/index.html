    The fact that it took so long to update the page to this is enough to show how little I care about the Bedrock version now. Yet you still somehow do. In that case, <a href="https://github.com/ANightDazingZoroark/Prehistoric-Rift-Addon/">download and compile the source code here</a>. There, you happy now?
