<h2>0.6.1 Patch Notes</h2>
<p>Ayyyyy another one of those big minor updates</p>
<p>Btw, this update adds compatibility between this addon with my other addon <a href="https://mcpedl.com/borgys-mobs/">Borgy&#39;s Mobs</a>, specifically version 1.3.3 (you should check that out btw). Just put this addon&#39;s behavior and resource packs above the behavior &amp; resource packs of Borgy&#39;s Mobs. It should look something like this:
