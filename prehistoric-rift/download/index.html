<h3>About Egg Temperature</h3>
<p>Egg temperature affects if the egg will hatch or not. For now, whether or not the egg is in water/rain, the biome the egg is in, and the temperature mode of a nearby Dimetrodon affect the egg&#39;s temperature. Some eggs may hatch in cold temperatures, normal temperatures, warm temperatures, or a combination of any.</p>
<ul>
<li>Biome Tags considered cold<ul>
<li><code>cold</code></li>
<li><code>frozen</code></li>
<li><code>taiga</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Biome Tags considered warm<ul>
<li><code>desert</code></li>
<li><code>mesa</code></li>
<li>the nether (<code>in_nether</code> is used to check if its in the nether instead of <code>has_biome_tag</code> but whatever)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This list will continue to expand in the future, and maybe one day I&#39;ll add a temperature system for the player (because I&#39;m evil muahahahaha)</p>
<p>Also, for the preferred temperatures of the eggs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tyrannosaurus, Stegosaurus, Triceratops, and Apatosaurus eggs require warm temperatures</li>
<li>Dodo eggs require neutral to warm temperatures</li>
<li>Parasaurolophus eggs require neutral to cold temperatures</li>
<li>Utahraptor eggs require cold temperatures</li>
<li>Dimetrodon eggs require neutral temperatures</li>
</ul>
