			  <br />
			  <center><img src="bakunawa.png" height="250"></center>
			  <br />
			  <p>
			    Bakunawas are exotic aquatic dragons that swim in the oceans in day, hunting anything they can find, including their own kind. By nightfall, they come out of the water to hunt for anything they find on the surface. They have a bite attack and a breath attack, both of which are equally as powerful.
			  </p>
			  <p>
				If you want to tame a Bakunawa for yourself, you need some powerful gear to kill them for a 12.5 % chance to get an egg. You then need to put the egg in water in order to hatch it. They take 8 minutes to hatch.
			  </p>
			  <p>
				Once you manage to hatch an egg, you can simply feed it all kinds of meat to tame them and make them grow up faster. Once they grow up, you can control them by looking up to ascend, looking down to descend, and jumping to switch between soaring and flying around.
			  </p>
			  <p>
				Another thing is that you can make them use their breath and bite attacks by utilizing the Bakunawa Staff. In order to craft such an item, you need to obtain a Bakunawa Heart. Bakunawa hearts can be obtained by killing Bakunawas and they will always have one.
			  </p>
			  <p>
			    Currently, they can spawn in all ocean biomes.

			<br />
			<p>
			  Houndeyes are pack hunters which utilize a shockwave attack to attack everything surrounding them, except for other houndeyes of course. They mainly attack villagers and players. Their shockwave attacks can deal more damage depending on how many houndeyes are nearby, dealing a maximum of 20 damage with 4 houndeyes in a group.
			</p>
			<p>
			  However, itâ€™s possible to tame them with all forms of cooked meat. Unfortunately their shockwave attacks still affect their owners, so be wary!
			</p>
			<p>
			  Currently, they spawn in plains and desert biomes.

			  To control them, just look up or down to move around, and press jump to switch between swimming around and to be unable to sink.
			</p>
			<p>
			  In order to utilize their powerful bite attack, you need to craft an Icthyosaur heart, which requires you to kill them in the wild. Once you obtain it, just right click/tap and hold while riding it.

				It is possible to tame them however. Just hold some rotten flesh and sneak up to them.
