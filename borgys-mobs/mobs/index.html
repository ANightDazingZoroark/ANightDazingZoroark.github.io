			  <br />
			  <p>
			    Bakunawas are exotic aquatic dragons that swim in the oceans in day, hunting anything they can find, including their own kind. By nightfall, they come out of the water to hunt for anything they find on the surface. They have a bite attack and a breath attack, both of which are equally as powerful.
			  </p>
			  <p>
				If you want to tame a Bakunawa for yourself, you need some powerful gear to kill them for a 12.5 % chance to get an egg. You then need to put the egg in water in order to hatch it. They take 8 minutes to hatch.
			  </p>
			  <p>
				Once you manage to hatch an egg, you can simply feed it all kinds of meat to tame them and make them grow up faster. Once they grow up, you can control them by looking up to ascend, looking down to descend, and jumping to switch between stay in place and flying around.
			  </p>
			  <p>
			    Currently, they can spawn in all ocean biomes.

			<br />
			<p>
			  Headcrabs are small parasitic creatures that will latch onto humanoid mobs. From there they will take over their brains and use their bodies in order to attack anything they can find as a source of food. For now, this includes players, villagers, and piglins.
			</p>
			<p>
			  Currently, they spawn in plains biomes, desert biomes, and underground.

		  <h2>Houndeye</h2>
		  <br />
			<center><img src="houndeye.png" height="250"></center>
			<br />
			<p>
			  Houndeyes are pack hunters which utilize a shockwave attack to attack everything surrounding them, except for other houndeyes of course. They mainly attack villagers and players. Their shockwave attacks can deal more damage depending on how many houndeyes are nearby, dealing a maximum of 20 damage with 4 houndeyes in a group.
			</p>
			<p>
			  However, itâ€™s possible to tame them with all forms of cooked meat. Unfortunately their shockwave attacks still affect their owners, so be wary!
			</p>
			<p>
			  Currently, they spawn in plains and desert biomes.
