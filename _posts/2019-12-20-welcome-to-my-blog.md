**Hello world**, this is my first Jekyll blog post. Yes, it is. I managed to figure out how the fuck I could do this, so I spent a week on looking up tutorials all just for this.

My plans for this area are for this to be a place where I can post things that feel too long to be posted on Twitter or Mastodon, such as progress for my addons and stuff. Anyways, I hope you loom forward to a development log being posted here soon!
