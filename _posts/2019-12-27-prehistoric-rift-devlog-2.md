Another developer log 2 days after christmas! Nice! Now that means more stuff to show off!

In the last developer log, it couldn't be sittable nor chested. Well that's fixed. To fix that, I had to use the `minecraft:equippable` and `minecraft:inventory` components for the tamed adults. It also somehow made using bones to make them sit/stand work. Can't explain why but whatever.

## Stegosaurus Demonstration Video

The Stegosaurus has received changes similar to that of the Tyrannosaurus, except this time they're sittable via sticks. Don't ask me about this. I also managed to fix the sitting position so that it won't look like the rider has been sucked in the body.

## What's coming soon?
* A function that will announce to the player if the tame is standing or sitting when interacting with it
* The ability to let the tame wander and be aggressive
* A command staff
* Various things described in [this page](https://github.com/ANightDazingZoroark/Prehistoric-Rift-Addon/wiki/Patch-Notes)

Well, that's all for now I guess.
