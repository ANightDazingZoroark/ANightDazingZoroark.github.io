title:  "Doom 3 is scary"

So one day on Steam, I got really bored. So I decided to play one of those franchises I've been hearing about and is loved by many people, which was no other than the Doom franchise. Well-known for it's soundtrack and it's gameplay which involved fighting demons with guns. What could go wrong?

Well, too bad I got mistaken. And it was nothing like the Half-Life series which I have grown to cherish. It's scary as hell (literally) in many fucking ways, and it's way too much for me to handle. Including the goddamn gameplay. 

And why would that be? Well, the atmosphere is one major factor for me. Not only is it usually quite dark, but there's this scary ambient sound that would play which enforces the paranoia and fear. Next of all are the enemies. The zombies/possessed humans are ok to deal with depending on what they are. If they're a regular zombie I would be just fine and would shoot them down. As for the guard and marine zombies, well, they're somewhat of a pushover and unless you have some form of cover or sufficient guns/health/armor you're just fine. Then... there are the demons.

Unlike the easy to deal with zombies, the demons establish themselves as monsters to be feared the moment you encounter them, especially when you first meat them. At least they can be killed with a shotgun at close range, but even if you manage to kill them they make a really horrifying screech. Like, tf?

And finally, there's the fact that the goddamn flashlight isn't attached to the weapons. Like, wtf. It could have been just attached to the player character since the very beginning and I would be fine, but this is just uncomfortable to deal with.

And.. there. It's way worse than SCP: Containment Breach in terms of horror, but yep, that's all I have to say about this, especially since I'm still in the fourth level with 2 hours of gameplay...
