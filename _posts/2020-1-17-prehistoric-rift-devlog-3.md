The day when the addon will be released via this website is right after this day! Before that, here's what's up with the addon's development!

## Saddle and Chest textures!

Well, yes, they're a thing. Whenever you equip a chest, a chest will actually be strapped on them. Same goes for strapping a saddle on them. Really neat, especially for me since while developing the addon I had a hard time identifying if a mob I see in the wild was tamed by me before or is just a wild animal.

## Tyrannosaurus Hunting Behaviors

I also put in quite a lot of effort into the AI. One such thing I added is how wild Tyrannosauruses hunt. Every 45-75 seconds, they will become hungry and will kill most things in their sight. This wears off after another 45-75 seconds when they will stop hunting.

The main idea behind this is that, just because they're carnivores doesn't mean that they have to kill everything they see all the time. They must have a limit of sorts on this, like how wild animals will hunt when they're hungry. Another thing to note is that, when a Tyrannosaurus that's not hungry gets provoked, it gets angry and will attack whatever the hell hit it, which also adds some more realism to the addon, at least in my eyes anyway.

## Stegosaurus Attack

We all know that the reason why the Stegosaurus had spikes on it's tail was to fend off against predators. Before this was added, they would just attack like any regular hostile mob. But now, they actively use those spikes on their tail to kill! And what's more, they're near unstoppable, as they deal a whopping 69,420,666 damage! Now good luck with that.

## Final Words
I feel quite happy as this is my first ever personal project to actually be released to the public, and I hope that this thing will be quite successful in the future as time will go on. Thanks for reading this, and goodbye!
