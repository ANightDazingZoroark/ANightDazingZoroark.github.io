So yeah... its been like almost forever since I updated this blog section because I don't really talk about most topics in detail (except mosquitoes). Plus, this site doesn't work really properly on mobile.

Biggest thing I'm probably going to do would be to revamp the site entirely so that it works on most platforms (like fusing this blog area with the rest of the site). I'm planning to use bootstrap as the main css file to deal with this. While this will happen the site is going to die for maybe a week. 

Another update I'm going to address is the lack of content involving Prehistoric Rift here. There's only boring descriptions of the creatures and the items, with no screenshots to show off the gameplay (or even a banner). I'm going to try have some models rendered in blender to make the banner.

Aaaaand thats all for now. yeet
