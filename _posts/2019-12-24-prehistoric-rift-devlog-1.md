Ahh yes. My first formal blog on this website at last. This will be a new series of blogs that I will be posting to show off all the progress I have done while making Prehistoric Rift. If you don't know what that is (please do), click [here](https://anightdazingzoroark.github.io/prehistoric-rift/). With that intro out of the way, it's time to start!

## Tyrannosaurus

It's one of the two dinosaurs that I've coded into the addon as of this moment (with more to come soon). I've planned the Tyrannosaurus to have the following components:
* Wild adults are gonna attack on sight
* Wild babies are neutral, but can be tamed (too bad they're rare)
* Once you tame a baby it will attack for you
* When a tamed baby grows up, you can ride it and attach a chest to it
* When riding an adult, you can right click (Win 10) or tap & hold (PE) to make a roar that scares off most mobs
* Bones can be used to make them stand/sit

As of now though... not all the components I've talked about here work properly. Heck, at one point in time it can be chested like normal, but then I did something and it won't work anymore for some reason. But hey, you can have a gallery of what I've done to these things so far:

## Stegosaurus

It's really underdeveloped other than the fact that at one point in time it's plates used to be surrounded with black and were thin. Components planned for this thing are: 
* Wild Stegos spawn in herds, are neutral, and can be tamed (including babies)
* You can attach chests & saddles to them and can ride them

I know that sounds boring but thats all I can think of when it comes to most of the herbivores this addon will add. Here's another boring gallery...

## Conclusion
Well, yep. That's all there is to it when it comes to the current progress of the addon. Until next time, peace!
