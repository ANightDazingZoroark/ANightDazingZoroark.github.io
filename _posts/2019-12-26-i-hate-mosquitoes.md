Well, what an anticlimatic sort of way to celebrate Christmas (which I did by the way, it was great). But there's one thing I really need to address really bad, because they're one of the many things I fucking hate in this planet. You guess it, it's mosquitoes.

Yep. These little fuckers. THEY FUCKING BITE YOU AND SWARM ALL OVER A PART OF YOUR BODY LIKE YOUR LIMB OR EVEN YOUR FACE. AND THE NOISE. AAAH FUCK THEY'RE ANNOYING AS HELL.

And it only gets fucking worse from there. Chances are they could carry a disease that will fuck you up 'till you get weak. Even though I barely experienced one, but you get the point anyway.

And that's all I guess. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
