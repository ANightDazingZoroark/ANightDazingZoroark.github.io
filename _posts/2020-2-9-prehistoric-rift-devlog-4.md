It's been a month ever since I even decided to update my own fucking website.... wow. Lots of things have happened over the past weeks since the addon's initial release on GitHub (MCPEDL page will come soon). Now, let's see what we've been up to...

## New Items
As promised by that [page on the GitHub wiki](https://github.com/ANightDazingZoroark/Prehistoric-Rift-Addon/wiki/Patch-Notes) that has the patch notes, around 11 new items have been added! Most of the sprites you see on the GitHub repository are merely the result of my very bad pixel art, so DT has been trying to make some new ones to replace them. That depends of if he will ever go insane or not...
### DT's textures
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><image src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/devlog 4/exotic meat raw.png" width="32" height="32"/></td>
	<td><image src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/devlog 4/command staff.png" width="32" height="32"/></td>
	<td><image src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/devlog 4/tyrannosaurus arm.png" width="32" height="32"/></td>
  </tr>
</table>
### My textures
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><image src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/devlog 4/exotic meat cooked.png" width="32" height="32"/></td>
	<td><image src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/devlog 4/fish treat.png" width="32" height="32"/></td>
	<td><image src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/devlog 4/flesh treat.png" width="32" height="32"/></td>
	<td><image src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/devlog 4/grassy treats.png" width="32" height="32"/></td>
	<td><image src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/devlog 4/leafy treats.png" width="32" height="32"/></td>
	<td><image src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/devlog 4/rooted treats.png" width="32" height="32"/></td>
	<td><image src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/devlog 4/stegosaurus plate.png" width="32" height="32"/></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## The Recode
I gotta admit, when I first made this addon before discovering bridge., I copied stuff from Gona's Tyrannosaurus addon and added a bit of my style to it. It felt pretty basic as a new addon developer, but now that I have a better understanding of making addons I decided to redo the entity definitions. 
<center>
  <table>
    <tr>
	  <td>
	    <image src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/devlog 4/old component groups.png"/>
		<br />
		Ye olde one
	  </td>
	  <td>
	    <image src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/devlog 4/new component groups.png"/>
		<br />
		Recode
	  </td>
	</tr>
  </table>
</center>
I essentially reorganized the components of each entity definition file and personalized the names of the component groups and events.

## New Models?
Yep, that's right! I also took the time to make some new models for the dinos because they looked so derpy, especially since they were my firsts outputs while I was still learning to model. And now, take a look at their upgrades:
<center><image src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/devlog 4/new tyrannosaurus.png"/></center>
<center><image src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/devlog 4/new stegosaurus.png"/></center>
Even though they're quite an upgrade from what they originally were, they have no animations yet, and are planned for an update after this.

Anyways, that's all for this devlog, and peace out!
