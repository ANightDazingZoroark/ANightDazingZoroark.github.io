Well, I can't put much personal information since this is the internet. But what I can tell you is that I'm 18 years old as of the time I'm updating this and I live in the Philippines. This website is basically where I upload my addons and information about them, and other weird stuff I would rather post here.
</p>
<p>
About my Minecraft Bedrock addon related stuff, I've been into that hobby for almost two years by this point. I've been into Minecraft since 2014 (as far back as I can remember), and I happen to have a deep passion for the game that has been extended via this hobby. I have been working on addons since 2020, and ever since then, well, I figured that I have achieved a lot.

I highly recommend that you view this site in desktop view since I'm bad at web design lol.
