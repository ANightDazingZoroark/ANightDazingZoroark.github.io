<h1>Welcome to my website, fellow human being</h1>

Well, I can't put much personal information since this is the internet. But what I can tell you is that I was born on April 11 2004 and I live in the Philippines. This website is basically where I upload my addons and information about them, and other weird stuff I would rather post here. Also, don't mind the navigation bar since most of the links arent working yet.
