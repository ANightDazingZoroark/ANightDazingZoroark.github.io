Well, I can't put much personal information since this is the internet. But what I can tell you is that I was born on April 11 2004 and I live in the Philippines. This website is basically where I upload my addons and information about them, and other weird stuff I would rather post here.

I highly recommend that you view this site in desktop view since I'm bad at web design lol.

<h2>Stuff you can check out</h2>
There's not much to feature here since this is just a homepage, but you can at least check out the navigation bar at the left
